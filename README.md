In this project I have attempted to find interaction between the various factors responsible for tip amounts during a ride in a yellow taxi in New York City. We found some linear relationship between certain atttributes and built a linear regression model.

The datasets have been loaded in the notebook using the URL of each month's CSV file. Additionally these datasets have also been included under external_datasets folder
