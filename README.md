# proj1_MAST30034

In this project I have attempted to find interaction between the various factors responsible for tip amounts during a ride in a yellow taxi in New York City. I carried out extensive plotting to see the interactions between various attributes and found some linear relationship between certain atttributes with which a linear regression model was built.

The datasets have been loaded in the notebook using the URL of each month's CSV file. Additionally these datasets have also been included under external_datasets folder
